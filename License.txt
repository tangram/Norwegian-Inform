License for Norwegian Inform (aka Norwegian.h) and its accompanying files
---------------------------------------------------------------------

No one may sell this package, alone or as part of anything else. The same
goes for any subset of this package, except the compiled code that is
included in game files compiled using this package.

Games which have been compiled using this package belong entirely to the author
of the game, and compiled games may be distributed in any way the author
chooses, including being sold for profit.

Derivative works must give proper credit as to the origins of the code. Game
authors do not have to give credit in compiled games if they don't want to.
However, I hope they will want to.

Derivative works may not be sold. Any distribution of derivative works must also
include this original license and possibly an additional license to further
restrict the use of these works.

Any use of this package which is forbidden by this licence, requires an
explicit permission by the author, who can be reached at
eirik.kr+inform@gmail.com.

Other people's work which is included in this package may have licenses of
their own. Don't distribute any of that work unless you know that you are
not violating their licenses. If in doubt, send a query directly to the
author of that work, or to eirik.kr+inform@gmail.com.
